In this directory we find files related to firmware development.

Source code files for individual projects (unit tapes) are located in separate subdirectories. Source code files athat are common to multiple pprojects are located in subdirectory libraries/Common. At the moment no third party libraries are used. In case they they were, they would be located in libraries/ subdir as well.

Subdirectory Version contains released binary update files.

Other files, that are not source code and are related to multiple projects are located directly in this directory.
